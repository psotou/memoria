This work postulates a novel method with the purpose of generating a model capable of estabish and predict the economic benefits associated with the use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) in indutrial building projects.

Particularly, the proposed method aims to relate the level of BIM integration in a particular project and how this integration impacts the costs growth in the construction stage of the project.

For this purpuse the method proposed also provides a metric which allows for the modeling of the inverse relation between the BIM level of integration of a project and its construction stage cost growth.

Addtionally, and in order to generate the method proposed which will allow for the prediction of the cost growth according the the BIM level of integration (BIM maturity), one needs the appropriate tooling to transform raw data into useful data, and, to estimate the desired parameters. Accordingly, this work provides two scripts in order to perform this tasks. These scripts were developed with Python.
